# CHMPX Node.js
CHMPX Node.js is an addon library that implemented [CHMPX](https://chmpx.antpick.ax/) (Consistent Hashing Mq inProcess data eXchange) of communication middleware published by Yahoo! JAPAN as open source so that it can be used on server side JavaScript environment [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## The purpose
We aim to make the high function of [CHMPX](https://chmpx.antpick.ax/) library adaptable to various development languages and environments, and to be able to use it with multiple platforms.
One way to do this is to provide a server side JavaScript environment [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) addon library.
This allows you to communicate between client applications in C/C++ and JavaScript languages using [CHMPX](https://chmpx.antpick.ax/).
